TODO: describe what you did
How long did each task take you?
I can't remember the exact time, but overall each task didn't took me too long. I was luckily to not stuck
on any task for a very long time. Probabily Task 0 took me the most time (2 hours?) because I didn't know where to start and had to go to office hour twice, once for some hints on how to start the problem, and once for debugging. 

What were some bugs you encountered?
One of the bugs that took me a while to figure out was in find_head. I was in a infinite loop because I only updated the character but not the positions associated with the character. I think the debugger really helped me a lot. I love the debugger. 

What was the hardest/easiest/most fun/least fun part of the project?
The hardest part for me was to get started. The project looks very intimidating and when I just started, I feel really shaky about pointers and memory allocation. That's why I went to OH twice for task 0. But everything after that works smoothly. (I still feel shaky about pointers and memory allocation!)

In addition, I hope it would be possible for staff to release a conceptual walkthrough later. I think my approaches to some problems were a bit weird -- for example, in Task 5 load_board, I went through the file several times and used rewind to get back. On piazza it seems that the staff is suggesting us to use realloc to reallocate space. I could not think of how to implement that approach, and it would be great if afterwards someone can explain that to me.
